# Dell-Precision-7520-OpenCore

### Before you give this EFI a try, make sure you read [this](#UEFI-settings) and [this](#Generating-your-own-serial-and-Editing-ROM)!

This repo includes an OpenCore EFI for the Dell Precision 7520. For the 7720 and AMD variants, we like to hear feedback [here](https://github.com/TECHNIKVERBOT/Dell-Precision-7520-OpenCore/issues/4).

## How to install

Download the latest release and place the EFI folder into your internal drive's EFI partition... That's it.

## How to Install macOS Ventura

Have a working install of macOS, [download](https://mrmacintosh.com/macos-ventura-13-full-installer-database-download-directly-from-apple/) the full installer package, install it to get the installer app, then make a bootable Installer with `createinstallmedia` by using this command in Terminal `sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Ventura.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/NameOfTheUSB`

After you have created a bootable Installer, copy the EFI folder to the EFI partition of the installer drive and install as usual (GUID Partiton Map; APFS). After the installation, mount the EFI partition of the installed OS and copy the EFI folder to its partition.

## Generating your own serial and Editing ROM

Use GenSMBIOS (https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate a serial for MacBookPro13,3 (Skylake) or 14,3 (Kaby Lake)

use Xcode, ProperTree or any decent plist editor to manually enter the details in the following sections of the config (as shown in the video): (SystemSerialNumber, MLB, and UUID)

You should also put in your ethernet adapter's MAC address into the ROM section.
